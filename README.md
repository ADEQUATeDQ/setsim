A library to calculate the Similarity of two ordered Lists using a combination of

* [Spearmans Footrule Distance](http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~bloch/P6/IREC/Ranking/77_04_spearmans.pdf)
* [Levenshtein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)

The items of the lists have to be bytes and, for comparability as a string, interpretable as UTF8-Runes.
